## Description
A turn-based, rogue-like zombie survival 2D game I built in 2017 Summer for a school project, written in C++, runs on Unix.


## How to run
Use the make file to compile into "Main" (run "make" command in terminal). Then, run "Main".


## Game objective
<ul>
	<li>Every level is a randomly generated maze. </li>
	<li>There is a "Gate" at the top right corncer to the next Level.</li>
	<li>To access the "Gate", player must find and use a "Key" on the "Gate".</li>
	<li>Survive as many levels as possible. You lose when you run out of Health Point (HP).</li>
	<li>There are two zombies on every level that will track you down and bite you.</li>
	<li>Every step you take consumes 1 HP.</li>
	<li>You can recover HP from consuming Bread or Water.</li>
</ul>
